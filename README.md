## Introduction

The Traffic Sign Recognition project is a machine learning-based system designed to accurately predict the type of traffic sign in an image. The system is trained to recognize various traffic signs that can vary in size, shape, color, and orientation.

## Features

- Accurate prediction of traffic sign types in images.
- Support for recognizing signs with variations in size, shape, color, and orientation.
- Real-time processing for quick analysis.
- 

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).**
3. **Upload an image containing a traffic sign.**
4. **The system will predict and display the type of traffic sign in the image.**
